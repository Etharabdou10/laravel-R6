<h3>In the context of HTTP methods used for RESTful APIs, PATCH and PUT are both used to update resources, but they differ in how they handle the update process:</h3>

<h1>PUT Request</h1>
Purpose: PUT is used to update or replace an entire resource.
Behavior: When you send a PUT request, you are sending the complete representation of the resource. If the resource already exists, it will be replaced with the new data provided in the request body. If the resource does not exist, it can be created (though this behavior can vary depending on the implementation).
Idempotency: PUT is idempotent, meaning that making the same request multiple times will have the same effect as making it once. This is because it replaces the entire resource with the provided data.

<h1>PATCH Request</h1>
Purpose: PATCH is used to apply partial updates to a resource.
Behavior: When you send a PATCH request, you only include the changes you want to make, rather than the complete representation of the resource. This is useful for updating specific fields of a resource without altering the rest of the data.
Idempotency: PATCH is not necessarily idempotent, though it can be depending on how it is implemented. This means that applying the same PATCH request multiple times could yield different results.

<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>PUT: Replaces the entire resource or creates it if it doesn't exist. Idempotent.</p>
PATCH: Updates only the specified fields of a resource. Not necessarily idempotent.
